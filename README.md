Researchers in academia generally agree that the data used in research are more important than algorithms. <br>
At present, we do not have publicly available similar face datasets. <br>
Therefore, the first goal is to establish a similar Face Dataset.<br>

This project provides similar face datasets generated using a multi-stage strategy for LFW and CASIA-WebFace.<br>
In the NEW folder, the paths of similar facial datasets collected so far are stored. <br>
The first column in each txt file is the Euclidean distance between the two, and the second and third columns represent two pictures. <br>
Smaller Euclidean distance means higher similarity.<br>

The whole dataset (simialr face datasets) is exceeds 1GB size <br>
Limited by github, we have provided 100 sample images here,
